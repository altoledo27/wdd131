            <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
            <p>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, 
                both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven,
                that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. 
                O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p>

            <h2>DyC 29:34</h2>
            <p>Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at ny time have I given unto you a law
                which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.
